## Currentlty Working On

- Polishing [OneExercise](https://oneexercise.mstflotfy.com/), my very first web app, currently in Beta.

## Dev

- I'm documenting and sharing the practical lessons I come across  while building my own indie apps on this website and my [YouTube channel (mstflotfy - indieDev)](https://www.youtube.com/mstflotfy+-+indieDev){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}

## Self | Productivity

- Iâ€™ve always struggled with discipline, mindsets, goals, and managing myself. And so I spent a long time thinking about those things.
- My plan is to turn some of the system I use to stay prodcutive into tools I can use everyday and share with others who might find it useful. [OneExercise](https://oneexercise.mstflotfy.com/), is the first of these tools. I aim to make it a workout tracker that I use to focus on mastering one exercise at a time. It's currently very usuable, but needs more work to simplify the core of the app.
