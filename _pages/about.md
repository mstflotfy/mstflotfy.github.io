## Currentlty Working On

- Building my very first app. A workout tracker that focuses on slowly building up progress for one exercise at time. 

## Dev

- I'm documenting and sharing the practical lessons I come across on this website and my [YouTube channel (mstflotfy - indieDev)](https://www.youtube.com/mstflotfy+-+indieDev){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}
- My first attempt to create a prototype for one of the apps I want to make (a habit tracking app) didn’t go too well. And so, I spent some time exploring Figma.
- While I will continue to explore Figma, I’m moving towards exploring more DEV related topics. 

## YouTube

- I am trying to post one DEV/DESIGN vid on YT per month.
- The popular advice is to release, at the very least, one vid per week. I attempted to do this when I started. But I noticed that this is leading to spending my time focusing on making vids instead of building my apps and gaining actual sharable experiences.
- I think, for now, I'll choose not to add to the noise. And I'll share when I have some value to add.

## Self

- Most of my app ideas are related to productivity/self-development/self-help/self-mastery/managing oneself (whatever you want to name it).
- I’ve always struggled with discipline, mindsets, goals, and managing myself. And so I spent a long time thinking about those things.
- In the past couple of years, I started tracking my habits and being more deliberate about managing myself. My system is still not perfect, but I’ve made progress.
- I'm currentlty busy building my very first app (an exercise tracker) and sharing the DEV & DESIGN lessons I learn. But I plan to start sharing some productivity and slef management lessons at some point.
