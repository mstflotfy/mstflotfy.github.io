## **Writing**

- I write articles on Web Dev as I learn and explore Jamstack.
- I write articles on productivity and self-discipline as I experiment with building a productivity system for myself.


## **Dev**

- I started [mstflotfy.com](https://mstflotfy.com) while learning about web dev and Jamstack. I used [Jekyll's Minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} as a template and started tinkering with it.


## **Illustration**

- I create doodles and illustrations for some of my articles.
- You can find some of my illustrations on [Creary](https://creary.net/@mstflotfy/projects){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and [Instagram](https:\\instagram.com/mstflotfy){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

## **Scuba Diving**

- I am a scuba diving instructor, currently diving in [Dahab, Egypt](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/dahab){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
