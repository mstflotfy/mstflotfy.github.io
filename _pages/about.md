## Dev

- Developing my own indie Apps is currently my main focus.
- I'm documenting and sharing the practical lessons I come across on this website and my [YouTube channel (mstflotfy - indieDev)](https://www.youtube.com/mstflotfy+-+indieDev){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}
- My first attempt to create a prototype for one of the apps I want to make (a habit tracking app) didn’t go too well. And so, I spent some time exploring Figma.
- While I will continue to explore Figma, I’m moving toward creating simple design systems and turning those designs into HTML and CSS code.
- Next, I plan to move on to exploring JavaScript, Vue, and perhaps Nuxt, and Tauri.
- I plan to develop mobile versions of my apps, and I plan to explore Flutter and perhaps SwiftUi. But web development is much easier to start with (for me at least), so that’s where I’m starting.

## Self

- Most of my app ideas are related to productivity/self-development/self-help/self-mastery/managing oneself (whatever you want to name it).
- I’ve always struggled with discipline, mindsets, goals, and managing myself. And so I spent a long time thinking about those things.
- In the past couple of years, I started tracking my habits and being more deliberate about managing myself. My system is still not perfect, but I’ve made some progress.
- I plan on sharing some of the lessons I learned on this website (sometime soon, I hope).

## Ink

- Many years ago, I wanted to get into graphic design. I found out that basic drawing is an essential design skill. So, I picked up drawing, got too much into it, and could not stop drawing since then. 
- I tried to give it up to focus on other things, but it kept creeping back.
- So instead of mindless doodles on every piece of paper, that came my way, I started to direct this toward making illustrations.
- You’ll find some of my illustrations in the INK part of this website.
- I’m also starting an [illustration gig on Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/share/xevE4x){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}.

## Scuba Diving

- Over the past couple of years, I’ve been exploring the underwater world via scuba diving. I traveled to Asia and did my PADI Divemaster there (A dive master is a certificate that allows you to work as a dive guide). Then I worked as a dive guide in Dahab, Egypt. Finally, I did my PADI dive instructor in Dahab.
- I’m currently taking a break from diving work for personal reasons. But soon, I hope to get back underwater and explore new places.

## Writing

- I write about things as I explore them. I try to document the practical lessons I come across as a reference for myself. And hopefully, those who share my interests find this practical advice of use.
- I'm currently focusing on writing about my Dev journey to build my apps. But at some point, I will start writing on productivity.

## YouTube

- I'm exploring the realm of YouTube. I'm still deciding how to go about it.
- The popular advice is to release, at the very least, one vid per week. I attempted to do this when I started. But I noticed that this is leading to spending my time focusing on making vids instead of building my apps and gaining actual sharable experiences.
- I think, for now, I'll choose not to add to the noise. And I'll share when I have some value to add.
- I will not stick to a schedule. But I expect to post one or two videos each month.
