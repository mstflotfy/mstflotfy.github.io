This article is a follow up to [How To Start A Blog](/dev/how-to-start-a-blog/), where I go through the reasons I choose [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to build my blog and the other options I considered.

Here is a part of its recap:

>I chose to host my blog on GitHub Pages, I built the site with Jekyll, and I bought a .com domain name from Namecheap.<br>
>
>
> Quick Reasons:
>    - GitHub Pages is free.
>    - It is quick and easy to start with Jekyll.
>    - .com is what most of us are used to.
>    - Namecheap had reasonable prices.


Before we start, there are a few things we need to get acquainted with. There is no need to attempt to become fluent with anything. The goal is to grasp the very basics for now.

As with everything new, repetition is necessary.

Head to each of the following pages and give it a quick read.

Do not be overwhelmed. This is an opportunity to know about things you otherwise would avoid. And perhaps some of those things might become your everyday tools in the future and transform the way you deal with your computer!

1. Installations.
2. Prepare The Template.
3. Minor Customizations.
4. Connect The Domain Name.
5. The Workflow.


The rest of this article is in the making! Iâ€™m a lazy bum who edits slowly. But worry not, it will be coming soon.
