**Hey, I'm Mostafa Lotfy.**

I write to better understand the things I struggle with.

I am no expert. I am overwhelmed by those things, so I seek to simplify.
Not to dumb down, but to find some entry point from which I can dig deeper. Or choose to stop if satisfied by the departure of the puzzling.

I write what I want to read. I write only about things I am interested in and currently engaged with.

- I write about productivity and managing oneself on this website, on the [Articles page](/articles).
- I also document the lessons I encounter while learning to code and write tutorials for the very beginner at [ dev.mstflotfy.com](https://dev.mstflotfy.com)
- I make illustrations and designs. You can find some of my doodles and illustrations on [Instagram](https:\\instagram.com/mstflotfy) and [Pinterest](https:\\pinterest.com/mstflotfy).
- I am a scuba diving instructor in [Dahab, Egypt](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/dahab). Although currently, diving is on hold for me due to the pandemic.
