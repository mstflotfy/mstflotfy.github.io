# Hey there.

My name is Mostafa Lotfy, and this is my blog.

Here, I write to better understand the things I struggle with.

I am no expert. I am overwhelmed by those things, so I seek to simplify.
Not to dumb down, but to find some entry point from which I can dig deeper. Or choose to stop if satisfied by the departure of the puzzling.

I write what I want to read. I write only about things I am interested in and currently engaged with.

WHAT AM I CURRENTLY STRUGGLING WITH?

{{### **Building A Self-Discipline System**
}}

## **Self-Discipline**

I am the kind of person who, without a plan, descends into chaos. I have been pondering (and at times making lame attempts at) having a self-discipline system for years.

Since the begging of the past year, I ventured into an exploration of self-discipline and productivity, mainly through experimenting. It has been ups and downs, but I continue to experiment and get content with the current slow progress, as at least it’s there.

I will share my thoughts on the subject in the [PRODUCTIVITY](/productivity) section.

## **Illustration**

I’ve been doodling for the past five years. Mostly, broken and ugly lines with glimpses of potential here and there.

Over the past year, I made noticeable progress. But I am still nowhere close to where I need to be.

I will write about some of the lessons and insights I picked up along the way that I believe will be useful to those who would like to take the self-taught path to learn to draw.

You can find this in the [ILLUSTRATION](/post-coming-soon/) section.

## **Coding**

I want to learn to code and perhaps build a self-discipline & productivity app.

I looked for a beginner-friendly first programming language to learn and choose Swift, which led me to SwiftUI. I am currently, very slowly, working on finishing the [free online course 100 days with SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

My initial intentions were to build this blog without coding to focus on SwiftUI and the many other things I got into. But the allure of [static websites and Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/what-is-jamstack/) pulled me in.

I am still at the beginning of this endeavor. I try to simplify some of the things I initially struggled with in the [DEV](/dev/) section.
