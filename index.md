I write to better understand the things I struggle with.

I am no expert. I am overwhelmed by those things, so I seek to simplify. Not to dumb down, but to find some entry point from which I can dig deeper. 

I write only about things I am interested in and currently engaged with.

I document the lessons I encounter while learning to code and building this website. I try to break down and simplify those lessons as best as I could on the [ Dev page.](/dev)

I write about productivity and managing oneself, on the [Self page](/self). That I have not created yet! Very productive as you can see.
