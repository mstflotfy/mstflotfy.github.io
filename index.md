# **Hello there.**
<br>
This is a blog.

Here, I write to better understand the things I struggle with.

I am no expert. I am overwhelmed by those things, so I seek to simplify.
Not to dumb down, but to find some entry point from which I can dig deeper. Or choose to stop if satisfied by the departure of the puzzling.

WHAT AM I CURRENTLY STRUGGLING WITH?

### **Myself.**

I am the kind of person who, without a plan, descends into chaos.
I have been pondering (and at times making lame attempts at) having a self-discipline system for years.

Now I finally venture into an exploration of self-discipline and productivity, mainly through experimenting.

I will be writing about my experience with building habits, and generally being more productive.
Anything related to habits, productivity and self discipline I will add to the posts in the PRODUCTIVITY page in the address bar.

It has been an ups and downs journey for me but I've made some breakthroughs, lost them, regained them, relaized they are not as worthy as I thought, changed my goals. I am still struggling but I am starting to see progress and gain insights.

I will write about my experiences here.

### **Building An Audience Online.**

I want an incentive to find answers for things I want to learn.
I have a bad memory so by breaking things down and writing about them I make them stick and this also would serve as a reference for myself in the future.

Anything related to writing, marketig, blogging, will appear under Marketing section. It's not here yet but will be here when I start writing on it.

My experience trying to gain an online audience.

I want to build an audience that I provide value for and return make a living working online.
If I fail I want to gain skills that I can use to work as a freelance online as well. That way I can live somewhere near the sea dive, and work online.

Perhaps even Video Editing.

### **Turning My Random Doodling Into Illustrations.**
I will share old and embarressing work.
I will share current work.
I will also share some thoughts and tips about illustration.

Illustrations I intend to use along with my articles.

### **Learning To Code.**

Swift & swiftUI to build IOS apps. I've already started doing this course: months ago but heading into multiple direction slowed me down. I will

And the technical side to this blog. It was not my intention to learn about the web currently but starting this blog pushed me towards this direction. But I am not getting deep into it still.

## Why Do I write?

I do not write for the sake of writing. I writing only about things I care about and that I am currently engaged with.

I try to be short and and to the point as another purpose of my writing is for those posts or articles to be references for myself in the future to fall back to when I forget and to also revise and control my understanding of certain subjects.

## Things I want to write about
  - My insights and ideas on building a self discipline and productivity system.
  - Booknotes that I can refer back to.
  - Course notes.

## What are my writing rules
  - It is important for me to have speed and consistency and produce an insane amount of work
  - But my main concern is producing work of quality.
  - I must reach a sweet balancing spot.
