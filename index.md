# **Hello there.**
<br>
This is a blog.

Here, I write to better understand the things I struggle with.

I am no expert. I am overwhelmed by those things, so I seek to simplify.
Not to dumb down, but to find some entry point from which I can dig deeper. Or choose to stop if satisfied by the departure of the puzzling.

#### **WHAT AM I CURRENTLY STRUGGLING WITH?**

**Myself.**

I am the kind of person who, without a plan, descends into chaos.
I have been pondering (and at times making lame attempts at) having a self-discipline system for years.

Now I finally venture into an exploration of self-discipline and productivity, mainly through experimenting.
