This repository contains the source code for my previous website, built using Jekyll with the Minima theme. I customized the theme to align with my Figma design. The site served as a personal blog and portfolio, showcasing my projects and writings.

The website was previously deployed on GitHub Pages but has now been archived. I have transitioned to a new version of my website using Next.js, featuring a redesign and restructuring aimed at better marketing my indie apps.

## Archiving Notice
This repository is archived and is no longer actively maintained. The website has been unpublished from GitHub Pages.

## Reason for Archiving
I moved to a new project built with Next.js, which offers enhanced performance, better SEO capabilities, and a more modern user & dev experience.

## Check Out My New Project
You can check out the code for my new Next.js website here: [New Next.js Project](https://github.com/mstflotfy/mstflotfy.com-2024-nextJs). Visit it live at [mstflotfy.com](https://mstflotfy.com).

## Screenshots

Since the website is no longer deployed I thought I'd add some screenshots from it here:
